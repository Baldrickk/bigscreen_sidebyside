# bigscreen_sidebyside
Takes standard side by side images and reformats them for viewing in Bigscreen Beta.  
View generated images zoomed to fill the screen, then turn on SBS mode.

To generate new image, drag an image over the .exe  Generated image will be in the same folder as the original.
The generated image will have the name original_name.edit.extension
So image.png will become image.edit.png
